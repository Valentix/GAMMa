# GAMMa-0.0-Ali
This project aim to continue what was the closed-source acpad (wich is now a closed project), with the open-source power.
The project name GAMMa stands for Guitar Arduino Midi Machine, and this is actually the first version.
The project aims to build a usb midi controller with arduino (I only have a nano at the moment) with 10 input touch sensors, a trimmer to set the starting midi note witch will be visible on a display.
This is a first version for this so it has problems and I mean a lot of problems but I already got to work and now the breadboard is here on my desk working with lmms (also opensource).
I'm a student at Politecnico di Milano so I don't have much time to build test and so the pull request may remain request for a long time. If you want to get involved in the project just do it put a comment in the C file with your name and do your best!
Because this is intended to use with a DAW and specifically with drums-set the name is based on the best Jazz drummers in alphabetic order for example this version is named after Rashied Ali more on him on wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashied_Ali.
