# GAMMa
This project aims to continue what was the closed-source ACPAD (wich is now a closed project), with the open-source power.
The project name GAMMa stands for Guitar Arduino Midi Machine.
The goal is to build a usb midi controller with arduino (I only have a nano at the moment) with 10 input touch sensors, a trimmer to set the starting midi note witch will be visible on a display.
I'm a student at Politecnico di Milano so I don't have much time to build test and so the pull request may remain requested for a long time. If you want to get involved in the project just do it put a comment in the C file with your name and do your best!
Because this is intended to use with a DAW and specifically with drums-set the name is based on the best Jazz drummers in alphabetic order.
