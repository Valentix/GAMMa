# GAMMa-0.0-Ali
This is a first version so it has problems and I mean a lot of problems but I already got to work and now the breadboard is here on my desk working with lmms (also opensource).
This version is named after Rashied Ali more on him on [wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashied_Ali).
For more informations look at he specific [README](./Versions/0.0-Ali/README.md)
