# Just the beginning of something amazing
Here i will upload the arduino cpp so you can try it too and build your GAMMa.
This version is actually more than an alpha it's just the start.
## Software Requirements
Because I'm using a nano the midi is indirect so the computer hosts the conversion of the serial to midi. In the future i will probably upgrade to a uno or a nano iot but the retrocompatibility is nice so... I even thinked of compile and create software to do that but i found something online and they already exist so why don't use them... Hairless midi-serial and loopMidi if you don't have a midi port like me.
here are the links for download

- [loopMidi](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html)
## Hardware required to build a prototype
- arduino nano: ATmega328
- display: tm1637
- trimmer 10Kohm
- 10x touch sensors: TTP223
- usb cable
- some wires
- breadboard
## User Requirements
just in case you want to take a look under the hood
- c++ understanding
- arduino ide familiarity
- patience because i'm not actually a programmer
- coffee

This version WONT BE MOUNTABLE ON GUITARS it's just a breadboard prototype. The next version will contain the freecad and stl file for the mounting plate.
